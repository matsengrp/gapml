Need to also download beast.jar from http://www.beast2.org/
Also should compile this code using java 1.8 (I can't get it working on the cluster. But it works on my local computer)

to compile this code:
```
javac *.java  -cp jars/beast.jar
```
to create jar file:
```
jar cmvf META-INF/MANIFEST.MF  tauGeodesic.jar Main.class
```
to run this code:
```
java -jar  tauGeodesic.jar <newick tree file 1> <newick tree file 2>
```
